AI automation is moving beyond scripts and macros into fully fledged copilots that orchestrate work. The next evolution pairs process intelligence with human oversight so every team member has a 24/7 assistant.

## Why it matters

- **Speed**: routine updates flow automatically between tools.
- **Clarity**: assistants summarize threads so leaders act faster.
- **Consistency**: best practices get encoded once and reused everywhere.

## What’s next

Expect more embedded AI surfaces inside CRMs, ticketing tools, and project dashboards—all powered by the same orchestration layer you control.
