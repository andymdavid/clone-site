Here are five battle-tested tools we install in nearly every engagement:

1. **Workflow orchestrator** to map triggers and actions.
2. **Knowledge base search** to answer questions from docs.
3. **Inbox copilot** for drafting replies.
4. **Analytics summarizer** for Monday morning recaps.
5. **Scheduling assistant** that books meetings with the right prep context.

Each assistant reduces context switching and keeps teams aligned.
